# Strobr
**a camera-based stroboscope**

Strobr is a camera-based stroboscope app that relies on continuously variable framerates to measure the frequencies of cycles. A traditional stroboscope flashes bright lights at a specific frequency that can be easily matched to the rotational frequency of i.e. a car wheel using persistence of vision (POV), allowing the rotational speed to be measured. Strobr works similarly, but can also measure many things like electrical light frequencies and very low slow rotations that a traditional stroboscope cannot. Itâ€™s also more convenient and much less distracting to others! This app was built at PennApps 2017 and won top 30 there.
